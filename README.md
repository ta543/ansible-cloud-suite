# üåê Multi-Environment Cloud Infrastructure Suite with Ansible üöÄ

## üìã Overview
This project aims to create a versatile, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure across multiple environments (development, staging, and production) using Ansible. It covers infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, continuous deployment, security compliance, and network configurations in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

## üîë Key Features

- **Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Ansible modules to provision virtual machines, networking resources (VPC, subnets, NAT gateways), security groups, and other essential cloud resources across multiple environments.
- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Implement dynamic inventories to automatically discover and manage newly provisioned cloud resources without manual intervention.
- **Configuration Management**: Apply configurations to ensure all servers are set up with the necessary packages, settings, and files needed for the deployed applications to run efficiently.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrated with GitLab CI to automate the testing and deployment of code changes to the respective environments.
- **Security Compliance**: Incorporate Ansible roles for security hardening of servers, compliance checks, and automated remediation tasks to meet industry security standards.
- **Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling**: Configure load balancers and auto-scaling groups to ensure high availability and scalability of applications.
- **Database Provisioning and Management**: Automate the provisioning and management of databases, including backups, restorations, and replication configurations.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Setup monitoring and logging solutions to collect, analyze, and alert on metrics and logs from all parts of the infrastructure.
- **Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation for the project, including setup instructions, architecture diagrams, and usage guides.
